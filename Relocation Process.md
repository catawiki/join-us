# Our Relocation Process

**1. Contract** 📝 

WOW! You accepted our offer and are about to become a fully fledged Catawikian… Awesome. To begin the process you will need to sign the contract and send it back together with a scan of your passport. In order for us to generate the contract you will need to fill in the 'HR form' attached to the original offer Email.

**2. Visa Application** ℹ️

We then notify our specialist international relocation partner "[Connect Relocation](http://connect-relocation.com/)" who sends across various forms for you to complete in order to obtain your working visa. They will ask for documentation including your birth certificate, marriage certificate and work contract. They send this across to the [IND](https://ind.nl/en) for approval and this takes around 6 weeks. Catawiki of course will cover the cost of the visa application. 

**3. Appointments with bank and municipality** 🏧  

After the permits have been approved, Connect Relocation will set up appointments for you to open a bank account (important!) and obtain your BSN number (essential!) for when you arrive in The Netherlands and help you start looking for suitable accommodation. 

**4. Accomodation** 🏠

Sometimes you can find an apartment before moving over and you can move in straight away. In the case you need a temporary stay somewhere, Catawiki will provide suitable accomodation in a hotel or apartment for your first 2 weeks. 

**5. Relocation Allowance**💰 

The relocation allowance that has been agreed in your offer will be paid in full to your Dutch bank account as soon as you have opened it. We’re aware that sometimes there are high initial costs and expenditures when moving to a new country and getting everything set up. So, in the case that you would like Catawiki to cover the cost of flights, housing deposits, or other associated moving costs, you can always speak to HR to find other options and together we’ll find the right option for you.

**6. Getting your bearings** 🗓️

Your first week in the Netherlands is likely to be filled with appointments (Opening your bank account, obtaining your BSN number, house viewings etc) so it is advised you spend some time getting the basics sorted before starting at Catawiki. 

**7. The Final step is to start life at Catawiki HQ!** 🏢 

There will be an official ‘onboarding’ day with other new joiners (across different departments) as well as a full technical onboarding and orientation so you can get up to speed quickly. In your first week you will have an appointment with HR for the last pieces of paperwork including applying to [the 30% rule](https://ind.nl/en/work/Pages/Highly-skilled-migrant.aspx) (if you are eligible). 

**8. Ongoing Support** 🍕 

We're a friendly and international bunch so there's a good chance that lots of the people you speak to here have been through a similar process and can share their top tips and tricks for getting settled in, whether it’s the best neighborhoods to live in or the best pizza restaurant to order take away from!
