# Our Relocation Process

**1. Contract** üìù 

WOW! You accepted our offer and are about to become a fully-fledged Catawikian‚Ä¶ Awesome. To begin the process, you will need to fill in the HR form attached to your offer email and then sign in via DocuSign.

**2. Visa Application** ‚ÑπÔ∏è

We work with the specialist international relocation partner [Hillbrook Expatriate Tax Solutions](https://www.hillbrook.nl/). In order to apply for and obtain your working visa (partner/family members also included), there are some forms they will ask you to fill in. They will ask for documentation, including your birth certificate, marriage certificate (both translated by a legal translator and legalized), and work contract. They send this across to [IND](https://ind.nl/en) for approval so you can receive your residence permit once you are here. Catawiki, of course, will cover the cost of the visa application. 

**3. Relocation Pacakge**   

After the permits have been approved, [Jimble](https://jimble.nl/) the relocation partner, can provide different services according to your needs:

3.a) Pre Arrival Counseling - to access specific needs
3.b) Settling in Services 
- Appointments with bank to open a Dutch bank account
- Appointment to obtain Dutch Social Security Number
- Accommodation*
- Detailed research on reputable schools and daycare facilities, including support in application procedures to ensure your children experience a smooth transition.

*Jimble will help you with your apartment search - from finding interesting prospects to organizing viewings and signing a contract. Sometimes, you can find an apartment before moving over, and you can move in straight away. If you need a temporary stay somewhere, Catawiki will provide suitable accommodation in a hotel or apartment for your first 3 weeks. 
 

**4. Relocation Allowance**üí∞ 

The relocation allowance agreed upon in your offer will be paid in full once you have opened your bank account and can provide your IBAN. We know that sometimes there are high initial costs and expenditures when moving to a new country and setting everything up. Always speak to HR to understand what the relocation aims to cover; together, we‚Äôll find the right option for you.

**5. 30% Tax Rule** üóìÔ∏è

Highly skilled professionals recruited from abroad may be eligible for the Netherlands‚Äô 30% tax ruling. Please check if you're eligible; HR will help set it up on your first days here at the office.
