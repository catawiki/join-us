# Our culture

Like the objects we curate, Catawiki is truly special. We work together to create an environment where passionate people make an impact. We combine art and science like no one else. We continuously strive for an inclusive company culture in which we attract, develop and retain high-performing, productive and diverse talents. Catawiki is committed to fostering this excellence and ensuring this potential is maximised, recognised and incentivised.

With over 60 nationalities, Catawiki offers a diverse and multicultural environment that allows everyone to learn from each other and embrace new ideas and perspectives. We thrive in our diversity, and we use this diversity to build a truly global platform of unique objects for users worldwide.
