# Catawiki Hiring Process

Are you thinking of becoming a Catawikian? Nice! We put time and effort into hiring at Catawiki to ensure the process is fair, efficient and transparent.

We would like to see if there is a match regarding your technical and communication skills and a cultural add. We‚Äôre not looking for clones of our existing Engineering team, but more people who want to help take themselves and Catawiki to the next level while having fun along the way! Equally, we have set up the process to give you an insight into what it's like to work here, a clear view of what problems you‚Äôd be working on, and an idea about whether or not you‚Äôd be excited about collaborating with the Catawiki team.

Here‚Äôs what you can expect when applying for one of our [open positions in Tech](https://catawiki.careers/vacancies?o=0&n=10&of=47810&f=194#vacancy-overview).

**1. Applying**  üìù

Applying to an open tech role at Catawiki is quick and easy! We will ask you for basic information, including your CV, a cover letter, and contact details.

The cover letter does not need to be a work of art from Shakespeare but more of a small summary of what excited you enough to apply for the role and why you think your experience could be a fit.

Top recruiter tip: Bonus points for including links to your Github (or equivalent)*, side projects, information about what projects you're most proud of and what objects on Catawiki you‚Äôre most intrigued by (yes, it‚Äôs true, we did once auction off the skeleton of a woolly mammoth for ‚Ç¨100,000!).

After you hit submit, you'll receive an email confirmation, and your application will be reviewed and responded to by our Recruitment team within 10 days.

The entire recruitment process will take place remotely, using phone and video calls. As we work in a hybrid mode, if you're based in Amsterdam, you're more than welcome to visit our office and have some of the rounds in person.  

*Although we like and respect open source contributions, having a Github profile full of projects and contributions is an added extra but, of course, not mandatory!

**2. Recruiter screening üìû**

We would like to hear more about you! This first call with our Technical Recruiters will last 30 minutes via Google Meets and aims to get to know each other and see if there could be a match both ways. We‚Äôll probably be asking you questions relating to:

- **Experience:** What have you done before, what are you currently doing, what tech stack are you most familiar with?
- **Motivation:** What does a perfect job look like to you? Why could Catawiki be a good next step?
- **You!:** What fun projects are you working on in your free time? Would you be relocating to Catawiki with your family or even a pet? Would you be interested in joining Catawiki‚Äôs Skydiving team or Board Games club?
 **The practical stuff:** Salary expectations, relocation possibilities, availability, etc.

We‚Äôll explain more about our history, business model and ambitions (it‚Äôs actually pretty cool how we‚Äôve scaled the business from our 2 founders in a small Dutch city to over 800 Catawikians worldwide!). We‚Äôll also discuss how our teams are structured and what to expect next in the interview process. There will also be plenty of time for you to ask questions as we want you to begin getting a feeling that this position and Catawiki, is right for you.

**Top recruiter tip:** Practice explaining some of the technical projects you‚Äôve worked on in a non-technical way, perhaps to a friend or family member, and see if they understand or are looking at you with a confused expression on their face!


**3. Technical Screening üíª**

This interview is carried out by video call (Google Meet) and will be with 2 of our developers. It takes between 45 to 60 minutes and has the purpose of getting a better idea of your troubleshooting and coding skills. They are also very interested in knowing more about your current role and how you engage as a team player. We aim to make the interview a collaborative discussion rather than an interrogation! The following topics are usually covered:

- **Breaking the ice:** What are you currently doing and what have you done in the past; kind of like a condensed version of the recruiter screening call.
- **Technical questions:** Here, we cover basic knowledge and explore what areas of technology you‚Äôre most familiar with (e.g. microservices, API development, databases, frameworks, system design, A/B testing, etc.). These will vary depending on what role you are interviewing for.
- **The Coding part:** focuses on your problem-solving skills and your thinking process. questions (usually done via a shared board such as https://coderpad.io//)
- A chance, of course, for you to ask questions

What we‚Äôre looking for in a candidate:

- **Best Practices:** What is your way of developing? 
- **Technical Skills:** It‚Äôs hard to tell everything in this call, but we hope to get a good idea about your level of knowledge on different topics to see what areas you could add value and what areas we could help you to grow.
- **Motivation:** Are you excited to develop end-to-end products and have an impact on users?

**Top Developer tip:** Preparing a few questions ahead of time is a great way to ensure you walk away with all of the information you need while showing interest in Catawiki and the role.

After the interview, we will discuss setting up the final interview rounds if the decision is positive. 


**4. Final Interview Rounds**

The final rounds usually comprise 1 behavioural interview and 2 technical rounds. 

Depending on your level and your speciality (Backend, Frontend, Android etc), the process will have different technical interviews. Don't worry; the recruitment team will be responsible for explaining in detail about these last rounds, depending on your case.

So you can best prepare, we will share in general what we look for when interviewing technically:

- **Technical Skills:** What is the breadth and depth of your knowledge?  Do you feel comfortable designing different systems? How do you solve problems? Can you discuss trade-offs?
- **Best Practices:** e.g. can you include unit tests bringing the BDD approach from the TDD methodology? Why authorization and authentication are important?
- **Language Specific knowledge:** e.g. How to do x and y in Rails or React.
- **Communications and collaboration skills:** Listening, clarity, concision, friendliness, empathy, open-mindedness‚Ä¶ these are all qualities we admire. Can you share/influence your ideas while being open to feedback and working collaboratively?
- **Culture Add:** Catawiki is an international company with people from around the world. We want people who are passionate about what they are doing, proud of what they have done and who can have a positive impact at Catawiki.

**Regarding the final technical interviews**, for the writing code part, we'll use Coderpad. For the diagrams part, we normally use Miro. We recommend you to have a quick play around with the above to familiarise yourself - it will make all the difference in your performance.

**Top Developer Tip:** Take a good look/have a play with the Catawiki website and app beforehand. This is helpful as we try to base our questions and scenarios around real-life problems we‚Äôre trying to solve at Catawiki.



**5. Decision üë©‚Äç‚öñÔ∏è**

After the final interviews, the interviewers will sit together to discuss the feedback and come to a mutual decision. This will be communicated to you within a few days of the final interview. In the event we decide not to progress, the recruiter will give you a call to discuss the feedback in detail.

If we decide that you are the perfect match for us, we‚Äôll call you to tell you the news and make you an offer! If you accept, you‚Äôll begin the relocation and/or onboarding process.


**6. Onboarding üëã**

Yes! You made it and are now a proud Catawikian! Awesome. The final step is to start life at Catawiki. There will be an official ‚Äòonboarding‚Äô week with other new joiners (across different departments) and a full technical onboarding and orientation so you can get up to speed quickly. 

If you're joining us in Amsterdam, in your first week, you will have an appointment with HR for the last pieces of paperwork, including applying to the 30% ruling (if you are eligible).

We're a friendly and international bunch, so there's a good chance that lots of the people you speak to here have been through a similar process and can share their top tips and tricks for getting settled in, whether it‚Äôs the best neighborhoods to live in or the best pizza restaurant to order takeaway from! No matter what happens, Catawiki is here to support you along every step of your journey.



**Diversity Statement**

Catawiki‚Äôs eclectic teams represent an international and intergenerational mix of people from different professional and cultural backgrounds. We foster an inclusive and queer-friendly work environment committed to making every Catawikian feel welcomed and empowered. Whatever your story is, we encourage you to bring your unique perspective to the table.


Catawiki stands with Ukraine and encourages people displaced by the current conflict to apply. In addition to the several initiatives we‚Äôve launched, we are open to hearing ideas on ways we can continue to support the humanitarian effort.
